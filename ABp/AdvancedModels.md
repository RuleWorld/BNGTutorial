[`GK.bngl`](GK.bngl)
: Goldeter-Koshland model of simple phosphorylation cycle.

[`Lisman.bngl`](Lisman.bngl)
: Lisman model of autophosphorylating kinase. This model exhibits bistability, which can be seen by varying the strength and/or duration of an input signal, `S` in the model, to see if the system retains memory of the stimulation or relaxes back to its initial state. The model demonstrates the use of the `setParameter` command to change the value of a model parameter at a particular point in time. It also demonstrates the use of trajectory continuation through the use of the `continue=>1` option to `simulate`. A continued trajectory resumes simulation at the point where the last simulation ended and appends further output to a single output file. RuleBender will display the trajectory generated by a series of continued `simulate` commands in a single plot, as shown here.
