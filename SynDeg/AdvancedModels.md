[`CircadianOsciallator.bngl`](CircadianOsciallator.bngl)
: A more complex model of an activator/repressor system that has a single steady state when simulated with ODE's but can exhibit stable osciallations when simulated with SSA. Demonstrates coupling of binding and synthesis. 

[`Repressilator.bngl`](Repressilator.bngl)
: Three-gene model of synthetic circuit that demonstrates cooperative binding and coupled binding and gene regulation. Also demonstrates use of `pla` simulation method.
